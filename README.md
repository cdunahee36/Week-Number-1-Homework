# Week-Number-1-Homework: Horiseon Webpage


## Horiseon Webpage Project Description
The application is in working condition. The code has been updated and cleaned up.
The URL links at the top of the page are now working and clickable. 
Each image on the webpage will show alternative text if the image does not load.
The only function of the webpage that has changed is the top URL links now really bring you to the webpage described.
